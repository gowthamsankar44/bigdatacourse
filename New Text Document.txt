Hi This is my first commit in Simplilearn Bigdata & Hadoop Developer course

Here I am going to do hands-on on Basic HDFS commands in Hadoop 

I am using singlenode Hadoop system which, I have installed in Ubuntu OS which is in my Oracle VM.


Things I have learned


Step: 1 Create text file using vi editor/notepad
step: 2 Create one directory in HDFS
Step: 3 Transfer that text file from my windows laptop to ubuntu system using winSCN
Step: 4 Transfer that text file from ubuntu local system to HDFS
Step: 5 Going to get details for all replicated blocks of the sample file
Step: 6 Deleting the file from HDFS.
